# Dark (dark.design) — reference (link only)

- Site: https://www.dark.design/
- Status in this library: **link-only** — no screenshots or page content were downloaded (the images on the site are screenshots of other companies' websites and belong to them).
- Last checked: 2026-10-09

## What this site is good for
- Focuses only on hand-picked **dark-background** websites ("from the dark side").
- Good for: learning how to pair light text with dark backgrounds, contrast, how to use accent colors/gradients/glow, and product photos on black backgrounds.

## How to browse / filter
- Filter by group: All, Agency, AI, Culture, Education, Hardware, Personal, Software, Web3.
- Sort: New / Popular.
- Templates section (includes a Free section) and the Monthly Picks newsletter.

## Notes
- When giving it to AI, also ask it to check WCAG AA contrast, because dark backgrounds easily make secondary text too faint.

## Sample prompt: have AI learn a layout / style from a reference URL

> Use this once you have picked a sample website on this site. Replace the parts inside `<...>`. The AI should only learn the **structure, spacing rhythm, text hierarchy and color scheme** — never copy the original site's text, logos, images or code.

```text
You are a UI designer and front-end developer. Analyze this reference website: <REFERENCE_URL>
(if you cannot open it, use the screenshots I attach).

1. List the sections top to bottom (name, purpose, grid layout: columns, alignment, image/text ratio).
2. Extract design tokens: type scale (px/rem), weights, line-heights, spacing scale, radii, shadows, colour palette (background, text, accent) as estimated HEX values.
3. Describe motion/interactions (hover, scroll, transitions) in words.
4. Then build a NEW page for my project: <PROJECT_DESCRIPTION>, following the same layout spirit but:
   - with my own copy, brand and imagery (use Unsplash/Pexels placeholders if needed),
   - without copying the original's text, logos, images or source code,
   - stack: <HTML + Tailwind CSS | Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui>, font: <Inter / other>, icons: Lucide.
5. Make it responsive (375px, 768px, 1440px) and WCAG AA contrast compliant.
